Description: A friendly and concise user interface for performing common
             tasks on 'rdf' data, such as parsing and converting between
             formats including 'rdfxml', 'turtle', 'nquads', 'ntriples',
             and 'trig', creating 'rdf' graphs, and performing 'SPARQL'
             queries. This package wraps the 'redland' R package which
             provides direct bindings to the 'redland' C library.  Additionally,
             the package supports parsing and serialization of 'rdf'
             into 'JSON-LD' through the `jsonld` package, which binds
             the official 'JSON-LD' 'javascript' 'API'. The package
             interface takes inspiration from the Python 'rdflib' library.
