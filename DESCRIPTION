Authors@R: person("Carl", "Boettiger", email = "cboettig@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A friendly and consise user interface for performing common
             tasks on 'rdf' data, such as parsing and converting between
             formats including 'rdfxml', 'turtle', 'nquads', 'ntriples',
             and 'trig', creating 'rdf' graphs, and performing 'SPARQL'
             queries. This package wraps the 'redland' R package which
             provides direct bindings to the redland C library. This
             interface takes inspiration from the Python rdflib library.
